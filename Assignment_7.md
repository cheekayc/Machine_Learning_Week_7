Do 5-folds cv instead of 10-folds because the outcome is so so so small
(only 159 outcomes)

# Data Partitioning

Partition the data into training and testing using a 70/30 split.

``` r
set.seed(123)

training.index = 
  admission$readmission %>% 
  createDataPartition(p = 0.7, list = F)

training = admission[training.index, ]
testing = admission[-training.index, ]

# I want to see if I have enough outcomes in my training dataset and if I should do "up" or "down" sample.
training %>% 
  select(readmission) %>% 
  group_by(readmission) %>% 
  count()
```
